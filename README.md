# Fruit-sort-AI
This project presents an intelligent system capable of identifying and classifying four types of fruits — apple, lemon, mandarin, and orange — based on their visual features. Using image-based data and machine learning techniques, the system automatically detects each fruit and assigns it to the correct category basket.
